### Hi Im Jason ðŸ‘‹

I am a iOS software developer currently on the job hunt for full-time work!
My three apps below are all currently on the App Store!
Scyne is a social media app, Alon Pablo (pablos portal) is a clothing store on an app, and Red Drums is a musc creation app.
Currently at the moment I am expanding my iOS development knowledge as well as learning c++.

More about me outside of software, I am a creative individual at heart, I play guitar and piano, and I make and sell clothing on the side! This creative side comes out when I am designing Apps.
